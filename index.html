          <p>My name is Darakhshan Ahmed, and I am a proud mom of 2 beautiful girls who are turning 10 and 3 this October. My
            youngest is currently starting school and my oldest is starting to become an independent young lady. Now
            that my children are getting older and becoming self-sufficient, I am ready to take on new challenges and
            work to learn, explore, and better myself! For the past few years, I’ve been working part-time and taking
            online courses while my children have been growing up, and as I’ve started to see my kids needing me less
            and less, I’ve realized that I can begin to take on new challenges and explore the open horizon!</p>

          <p>In the past, I started a project for an online platform that enabled tutors and students to meet one another on the web, with the goal of maximizing opportunities between both by 1) giving students a selection of tutors which could be filtered to best fit their needs and 2) connecting tutors to students who needed exactly what they offered. Due to time and budget constraints and a lack of expertise, however, I couldn’t reasonably continue to pursue this project while supporting myself and my family. I’m currently looking for guidance and/or other contributions to redirect the trajectory of this venture, so please don’t be afraid to contact me or look into this project further. I'm still managing the Facebook page created for our website to grow its audience, and it's grown so much! Here's the link:

          <p>For hobbies, I love DIY and crafting, especially with my older daughter, who’s grown into a smart and
            creative young lady. Being nifty and creating things is one of my favorite feelings, and whenever I get the
            chance my daughter and I try different projects.</p>

          <p>Also, being a mommy of two girls on a budget has taught me to look for deals, coupons and bargains. At some point, I had the inspiration to create a Facebook group where I shared amazing deals so others can start saving, too. I have several Amazon sellers who directly send me discount codes for me to add to the page. I manage the group often, and I love seeing people responding to and getting the deals I share, especially moms! I would love for anyone looking for a deal to check it out here:

          <p>Professionally, I’ve been a database coordinator, data quality analyst, and microcomputer lab assistant.
            In total, I’ve worked in the field of databases and data analysis for over a year. I graduated from the
            Bioinformatics Training Certificate Program (BITMAP) from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2007 and
            received a Bachelor of Science in computer science from DePaul University in 2004.Currently, I’m enrolled at Northwestern University to get a certification for a Full Stack Web Developer.
